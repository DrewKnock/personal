          My name is Andy Knockel and I am a Software Engineering student at
          Iowa State. This simple website was made for the class SE/COMS 3190 as
          an introduction to HTML and CSS. Try using the navigation buttons at

          <h3>Simple Raycasting Graphics in C</h3>
          <p>
            This project is a pseudo-3D graphics demonstration using a technique
            called raycasting. Essentially, a player exists in a 2D top-down
            environment (left side of screen) that has walls and open space. The
            player emits "rays", which can be thought of as beams of light that
            gather information about the environment. The rays travel until they
            hit a wall or reach a defined depth limit. For each ray, a vertical
            strip is drawn (right side of screen) that has a fixed width and a
            height that is based on the distance the ray traveled. If the ray
            traveled a long way (wall is far away) the strip will be drawn
            shorter and vice versa. These strips are colored different shades of
            blue based on the orienation and distance of the wall. They are also
            drawn over a gradient of white and black which gives the illusion of
            a floor and ceiling. Look closely at the image and you can see the
            "steps" where each rectangle is drawn.
